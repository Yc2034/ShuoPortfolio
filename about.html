        HELLO,I AM SHUO HAO
      </p>
      <div class="main_wrap_desc">I have had a strong passion for painting since I was a child, so I have been learning
        it since I was 7 years old. I studied at Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts with a Bachelor's degree in F ashion and
        Pattern Design. After that I worked in the fashion industry for more than 7 years. Due to the rise of digital
        media design, I took a program of Interactiv Media Management for one year and since then I am fascinated by
        digital design. I enjoy the pleasure of creative processes of graphic design, UX design, website design,
        animation creation, video creation and so on, which would be the center of my design career.in the future.</div>
