        HELLO,I AM SHUO HAO
      </p>
      <div class="main_wrap_desc">From a young age, my passion for painting was evident. I began formal training at the age of 7, a pursuit that 
        eventually led me to the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Fashion and Textile Design. After graduation, 
        I immersed myself in the fashion world, accumulating over seven years of professional experience. Recognizing the growing prominence of 
        digital media, I expanded my skills by undertaking a program in Interactive Media Management. This course ignited a new passion within me 
        for digital design, encompassing areas like graphic design, UX design, website creation, animation, and video production. I envision these 
        fields being the cornerstone of my future design career.</div>

              Painting serves as a therapeutic escape for me. Not only does it hone my critical thinking, but it also sharpens my fine motor skills.
               Through each brush stroke, I build confidence, cultivate positivity, and foster emotional development.
